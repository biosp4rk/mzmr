1. Overview
-----------
Metroid Zero Mission Randomizer is a program created by biospark that lets you randomize various aspects of Metroid Zero Mission, primarily item locations. It has been expanded by Caption Glitch to include some additional options.
It can randomize palettes, enemies, enemy stats, text, and music. It is only compatible with the North American (U) version of the game.

Bug reports and questions should be directed to the MZMR thread on the Metroid Construction forums: http://forum.metroidconstruction.com/index.php/topic,4559.0.html
You can also find the latest updates and releases there.

--------
2. Usage
--------
To start, open an unmodified ROM of Metroid Zero Mission. ROMs that have been previously randomized cannot be used. Once the ROM is open, you can select a variety of randomization settings. All of the settings have tooltips if you hover over them, which explain their functions. You can reuse settings by saving them to a file and loading them later. You can also load settings from a string, which can be found after randomization or in a log file.

You can specify the seed to use for randomization, which must be a number between 0 and 2147483647. If left blank, a random seed will be chosen. Unless you're using the same seed and settings as someone else, there's no reason to provide a seed.

Click on the gear icon to bring up application settings. Here, you can enable some time-saving options, including automatically loading the previous ROM and randomization settings, and always saving a log file and map images.

--------
3. Items
--------
You can randomize the location of abilities (such as Wave Beam, Hi-Jump, etc.), tanks (Energy, Missile, Super Missile, Power Bomb), or both. You can also remove up to 90 items. Removed items are marked as collected on the minimap.

The "Game Completion" setting places restrictions on where items are located. If "No logic" is selected, there are no restrictions. However, you will immediately get stuck if Morph Ball is not the first item. "Beatable" means enough items can be obtained to beat the game. "100%" means that all items can be obtained.

There are two settings that remove item requirements, since they may be located somewhere inaccessible. One makes Metroids vulnerable to missiles when not frozen, and the other makes black space pirates vulnerable to beams other than Plasma. Neither of these items is required elsewhere.

The "No PBs before Chozodia" setting places restrictions on where Power Bombs are located. No Power Bombs can be obtained to enter Chozodia early, forcing you to fight Mother Brain and do the suitless sequence. Normally the game will softlock if you obtain Power Bombs before Bombs, but the game has been modified to prevent this.

The "Chozo statue hints" setting makes Chozo statues show the new location of each item. For example, the very first Chozo statue in the game will show where Long Beam is. If left unselected, Chozo statues won't show any hints.

If you aren't skilled at bomb jumping or wall jumping, you can leave these options unselected. This will ensure that these tricks are never required to beat the game (if you selected "Beatable") or collect all the items (if you selected "100%").

------------
4. Locations
------------
You can specify what to do with the item at each location. By default, every item is included in the pool for randomization. For each location, you can leave it as random, remove the item, or set it to a specific item.

-----------
5. Palettes
-----------
You can randomize the colors of tilesets, enemies, Samus, and beams. This works by changing the hue of each palette (much like rotating a color wheel). You can specify the hue rotation range, between 0-180 degrees. For each palette, the hue is randomly rotated clockwise or counter-clockwise by a random amount within the range.

-----------
6. Text
-----------
You can randomize various text thought the game using a set of predefined strings within the randomizer. There are some options that allow you to choose which text to randomize.

Items will change the item names and descriptions. It will not change the status screen. Areas will change the location messages. 

Cutscene will change the three long messages seen at the start of the game and the ones at the start of the Zero Suit section.

Misc. will change file-screen and misc. messages such as save messages.

-----------
7. Music
-----------
You can randomize the room and boss music in the game. You can also choose to enable custom music. (Credit to JRP and Xl for creating the tracks).

Each option has a "No Logic" and "Structured" setting. No Logic will assign any valid track randomly, and will often result in each room having a different song.
Structured will ensure that each song is replaced with only one other song. 

-----------
8. Stats
-----------
You can randomize most of the enemies in-game stats. 

Health and Damage stats are randomized based on a range that you define. Note that the ranges are percentages.

Weakness stats effect less enemies than the other option in order to prevent invincible bosses or enemies that could result in a softlock.
Otherwise each weakness has a 50% change of being checked.

Drop stats are randomized to give enemies different drop values than they normally would.

-------
9. Misc
-------
There are a variety of options you can select that affect gameplay, most of which are enhancements. The option "Obtain unknown items" is taken into account by the "Game Completion" setting.

There's also an option to randomize enemies, but it's somewhat limited for now. More enemy randomization features will be added in future updates.
