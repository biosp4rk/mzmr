[COLOR]There once was a man from Peru. He dreamed he was eating his shoe. He awoke with a fright in the middle of the night to find that his dream had come true.[NEWLINE]             -Samus Aran-
[COLOR]We're in the deepest trenches of gaming, producing games for gamers. Here is where stuff gets cross- pollinated. Strange, difficult. Average metroid fans don't play hacks, they have other things to do, other games, other hobbies. We are here for  a reason.    -Ing-Ing-
[COLOR]Greetings, my dearest gamer, for it is my pleasure to pass on to you the notification which states the undoubted fact that the 1994 Super Nintendo Entertainment Console game Super Metroid, is a superior work to the likes of the 2004 Game Boy Advance portable video game, Metroid: Zero Mission.                -Jiffy-
[COLOR]We meet again, my companion. My ongoing respect for you allows me to, once again, notify you, as I always do, that you are very much an individual of utmost excellence.[NEWLINE]               -Interdpth-
[COLOR]Rise and shine my aquaintance, for it gives me feelings of happiness to forward the derective, as I do, that the 1991 Game Boy portable video game, Metroid II: Return of Samus, is an artistically and technically superior work to all subsequent entries in Nintendo's Metroid franchise of electronic computer entertainment.      -Whalerynth-
[COLOR]A Space Dragon and its metallic recreation decided to lay waste to my poor Zebes. Their motives are unclear but I do not care what they are. I am bored. So I will hunt these heatens & brutally kill them to alleviate my boredom. The metal one is my main target, but killing both would be radical.          -Samus Aran-
[COLOR]Now this is a story all about how my life got flipped-turned upside down. I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there, I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel Air.
[COLOR]Prepare for trouble and make it double! To protect the world from devastation! To unite all pirates within our nation! To denounce the evils of truth & love! To extend our reach to Zebes above!        Kraid!            Ridley! The pirates blast off at the speed of light! Surrender now, or prepare to fight!
[COLOR]For time and the world do not stand still. Change...is the law of life. And those who look only into the past or the present, are certain to miss the future. I said 'are certain to miss the future!'
[COLOR]It is this fate, I solemnly assure you, that I dread for you, when the time comes that you make your reckoning, and realize that there is no longer anything that can be done. May you never find yourselves, men of Zebes, in such a position! Yet in any case, it were better to die ten thousand deaths than to let Zebes fall to the Hunter.
[COLOR]Spooky scary skeletons Send shivers down your spine Shrieking skulls will shock your soul Seal your doom tonight Spooky scary skeletons Speak with such a screech You'll shake and shudder in surprise When you hear these zombies shriek

[COLOR]Zepone's answer ... Here I have called a house once, at natural times, before the wrong time leading up to a crime in the lower pits. So let me tell you the story of my first battle here ... Operation is different.[NEWLINE]       -Samran Aran-

[COLOR]I AM THE SERVER' says Biospark spitting garbled pieces of Samus' suit onto the floor, delaying the Samus Editor by another month.
[COLOR]Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life...,
[COLOR]The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic.
[COLOR]I once again find myself bored and eager to slay a dragon. In my effotr to quell this desire, I found a strange realm with mystical properties. I smell  a dragon here, so I shall do what I must to reach it. -Samus Aran-
[COLOR]Hold your breath and step forward, to the world that just a day will last, for 24 hours it has been built, and no more will it dream of existing.
[COLOR]-Adam's Order- The space pirates have requested you to infiltrate their abandoned base that a rouge AI took over! I don't think we can trust them, so be on the lookout for any traps!
[COLOR]The Federation landed on this heated planet. I have to be careful not to get burned. I will rest for a while in an old Federation station but I have to move on...   -Metconst contest/WhaleConner-
[COLOR]This appears to be quite a predicament, Samus. Data analysis varifies that the planet's inhabitants are indeed troubled by pollution. But the pollution itself is not the main problem. Shine Sprites are the source of power on planet Zebes. They used to gather in great numbers at Tourian. But the graffiti incident has caused them to flee. -F.L.U.D.D.-
[COLOR]I wondered if this, too, was a result of the power the baby gave me. Not even a fragment... None of the baby remained on me. I knew it to be true but still couldn't help looking at my palm for a sign. Never again would I encounter the baby. Never. The finality of it struck me once again.
[COLOR]The healthy human mind doesn't wake up in the morning thinking this is its last day on Earth. But I think that's a luxury, not a curse. To know you're close to the end is a kind of freedom. Good time to take...inventory. - Price

[COLOR]Samus meets a transgender version of Samus, and they have an intersex baby, but then the adult Samus realizes that the bedongled Samus is her biological twin brother.  Then the intersex baby they had grows up, goes back in time and impregnates themselves and gives birth to the two original Samus's. Hence infinite cycle of Samus.
[COLOR]Actually the 2 data points we do have, if fit to a curve, make a lot of sense. As the Quote time estimate becomes larger it rapidly becomes more accurate to real time. 2 minutes = 2 hours, but 20 minutes = only 3 hours. If anything it actually is logarithmic, so 4 hours is almost exactly four hours.  -Ozzatron on Quote58 Time Thoery
